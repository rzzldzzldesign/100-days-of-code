# 100 Days Of Code - Log

## Day 0: April 18—2020

**💅PROGRESS**: DAY 0 BABY! Worked on a lesson (day 5) from [Kevin Powell](https://www.kevinpowell.co/)'s course about Conquering Responsive Design.

**🤔LEARNINGS:** The web is inherently responsive! Learned about implementing variable fonts for the first time:

>This dynamic typography uses continuous ranges of styles, offering all the weights between 100 and 900 on a page, and responsively varying the weight based on some conditions.
>To request a range of a variable font axis, join the 2 values with `..`
>[LINK](https://developers.google.com/fonts/docs/css2#axis_ranges)

Experimented with a fun animated hover state on the button. Also set up this git repo and learning how to write markdown!

## Day 1: April 19—2020

**💅PROGRESS**: Day 1 feeling super tired today so no huge progress. Did an hour and a half of Javascript practise including Module 8: Data Types: Objects + Objects References Vs Values from Wes Bos's Beginner Javascript course. Also continued with FreeCodeCamps Basic Javascript course.

**🤔LEARNINGS:** Changing values of properties within an object mutates the original object which can cause bugs. When modifying obkects make sure to create a copy of the original using the `...` spread operator.

**🌐LINK:** No link today as its all just taking lessons.
