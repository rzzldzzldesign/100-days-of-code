# 100 Days Of Code - Log

### Day 0: April 18—2020

**💅PROGRESS**: DAY 0 BABY! Worked on a lesson (day 5) from [Kevin Powell](https://www.kevinpowell.co/)'s course about Conquering Responsive Design.

**🤔LEARNINGS:** The web is inherently responsive! Learned about implementing variable fonts for the first time:

This dynamic typography uses continuous ranges of styles, offering all the weights between 100 and 900 on a page, and responsively varying the weight based on some conditions.

To request a range of a variable font axis, join the 2 values with `..`

Experimented with a fun animated hover state on the button. Also set up this git repo and learning how to write markdown!
